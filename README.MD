# üöÄ CodiAlias

**CodiAlias** is a simple solution to address compatibility issues between [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) and extensions relying on hard-coded Visual Studio Code commands (like `code`).

## ‚ú® Features

This project copies scripts into the VSCodium commands directory, enabling `code` commands (native to VSCode) to work seamlessly within the VSCodium environment. This eliminates compatibility breaks caused by poorly implemented extensions.

## üìã Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows only.
- **Permissions**: The script **must be run as an administrator** to perform the required changes successfully.

## üö® Important Note

Running this script may cause **compatibility issues** if you already have Visual Studio Code (VSCode) installed on your system.  
The `code` command for VSCode will be overridden by this script, potentially affecting your existing setup.  
Please proceed only if you are aware of these implications and are comfortable with the changes.
